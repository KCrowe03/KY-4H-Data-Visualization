# Lincoln County 4H Data Visualization

This project uses a mock dataset inspired by 4H involvement in Lincoln County, Kentucky. The data is not real but was created to practice building visualizations using pandas and two different plotting libraries. The goal was to create six charts that show different ways to explore and present data while practicing data cleaning, grouping, and file organization.

## Challenges

 Learning how to handle multiple values in one column, such as students in more than one club
 Using `.explode()` to separate club membership into multiple rows
 Managing file structure and relative paths in Jupyter and GitHub
 Keeping the charts readable and clear for anyone unfamiliar with the data
 Staying organized while committing changes and building toward a complete analysis

## Skills used

Read, clean, and organize data using pandas
Identify and handle missing values
Group and sort data to answer real-world questions
Create six different plots using both matplotlib and seaborn
Use GitHub to organize, version, and share the project


## Visualizations

Bar chart: Which clubs have the most students?

Pie chart: What schools do 4H students attend?

Bar chart: Which clubs require the most hours per week?

Histogram: What ages are most common in 4H?

Box plot: Which clubs keep students for the most years?

Line chart: How does age relate to years in 4H?
